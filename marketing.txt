## "Clay" MUD Client Inducted Into Digital Heritage Collection; Archivists Weep Openly

**The last great text client that refused to die finally gets its due**

NEW PORTLAND — Sixty-three years after its initial commit, the Clay MUD client has been formally inducted into the Digital Heritage Collection at the New Portland Retro Computing Museum, where it will join other artifacts of the late terminal era including three functioning VT-220s and a signed photograph of someone's grandmother who once met a BSD developer.

"We simply had to have it," said Chief Archivist Dana Okonkwo, dabbing at her eyes with a microfiber cloth. "When we discovered that Clay could *hot-reload its own binary while preserving active TCP connections*, we knew we were looking at something special. The previous owner demonstrated this feature and I had to sit down."

### A Client Out of Time

Clay emerged during what historians now call the "Second MUD Renaissance" of the 2020s, when a small but devoted community continued playing text-based multiplayer games despite having access to fully immersive neural interfaces. What set Clay apart was not merely its feature set, but its apparent inability to decide what decade it belonged to.

"The tagline was 'A 90dies MUD client written today,'" explained Dr. Hiroshi Tanaka, professor of Digital Anthropology at MIT-Luna. "This was technically accurate. It used async Rust with tokio, supported TLS 1.3, and included a complete WebSocket server for remote access. But it also let you convert Fahrenheit to Celsius *as you typed*, which suggests the developer may have been playing MUDs in a very cold room."

### Features That Defied Explanation

Museum staff have compiled a partial list of Clay's more unusual capabilities:

- **TLS Proxy Mode**: When enabled, the client would fork a child process to handle encrypted connections, allowing the main process to `exec()` a new binary without dropping the connection. "This is the software equivalent of replacing your car's engine while driving on the highway," noted Okonkwo. "It should not work. It does work. We have tested it eleven times and cried each time."

- **Simultaneous Multi-Interface Operation**: A single Clay instance could be controlled via terminal, web browser, and native GUI client simultaneously, with all three interfaces staying synchronized. Activity indicators, scroll positions, and unseen message counts were shared across all views. "They solved a distributed systems problem so they could type 'kill orc' from their phone," said Dr. Tanaka. "Priorities."

- **ANSI Music Support**: The client could parse and play ANSI music sequences through connected web and GUI clients, a feature dating back to BBS-era PC speaker abuse. Museum visitors can experience this firsthand, though headphones are recommended and therapy dogs are available.

- **TinyFugue Compatibility Layer**: For users migrating from the legendary TinyFugue client (circa 1990), Clay offered a complete `#command` syntax including triggers, hooks, macros, and an expression evaluator. "It's like finding a modern car that still accepts a hand crank," said longtime MUD player and oral historian Rebecca Chen, 94. "You don't need it, but you're glad it's there."

- **Crash Recovery**: Upon detecting a panic, Clay would save its complete state—including output buffers, scroll positions, and connection file descriptors—then attempt to restart itself. "The client refused to die," Chen added. "Much like the MUD community itself."

### The Temperature Thing

Perhaps no feature has generated more scholarly debate than Clay's inline temperature conversion. When enabled, typing "32F " would automatically expand to "32F(0C) ". Users could backspace to remove the conversion, and the client would remember not to re-convert that specific temperature until a new word was started.

"We've run focus groups," said Okonkwo. "We've interviewed surviving users. We still don't know why this was considered essential functionality. The prevailing theory is that someone was playing from Finland and kept needing to know how cold the in-game weather was in real units. We may never know for certain."

### Legacy

Clay's influence can be seen in modern neural-link interfaces, which still support a "retro text mode" that owes much to the client's careful handling of ANSI escape sequences, word wrapping, and Unicode width calculations. The museum's working installation runs on original hardware and accepts visitors who wish to experience what Dr. Tanaka calls "the last era when you had to actually type your attacks."

"There's something pure about it," said Chen, who still maintains an active character on a MUD that has been running continuously since 1992. "You type 'look'. The room description appears. You type 'north'. You go north. And if you're using Clay, you can do this from your terminal, your browser, or your GUI client, and they all stay perfectly in sync, and your TLS connections survive a hot reload, and you know exactly how cold 32 degrees Fahrenheit is in Celsius."

She paused, gazing at the terminal display.

"We were so happy then."
